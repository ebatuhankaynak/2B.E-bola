e-Bola project repository for group 2B


As group 2B, our project is a real time strategy - puzzle game, which consists of 4-5 levels.
The main idea of the project is improving the main character's attributes with items found around the map,and by solving puzzles, and becoming powerful enough to defeat the boss, the deadly ebola virus. 

The game starts with a cell membrane, that doesn't have any organelles in it. In the first level, the player wanders around to improve the cell accordingly with organelles, and proceeds to the second level. The cell solves some puzzles to get the keys of locked treasure chests. Here, the cell reproduces, and becomes 2 cells. These two cells defeat others to gain nucleotides, which are the currency in the game. In the third level, there is a timeskip and the two cells make a complete organism.  In this level, the organism collects more nucleotides by battling small bacteria, and solving some puzzles. After a while, the organism gathers enough nucleotides to mutate itself, and to face the deadly ebola virus. In the last level, the organism has to defeat the virus by surviving a fierce battle, and after defeating it, the organism continues its life, peacefully.
